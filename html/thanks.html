    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-shadow: 5px 5px 2px grey; font-size: 300%; font-family: fantasy;">T</span>here are moments in life that mark the beginning of something greater—a small spark that starts a fire. This website is one of those moments for me. What began as an idea, a blank canvas, has grown into a living project, a milestone, and a testament to the people who stood by me, guided me, and believed in me when I wasn’t sure I could pull it off.</p>
   <h4>To my collaborators—this section is for you.</h4> 
    <p>Thank you for being more than just contributors. You were mentors, motivators, sounding boards, and teammates. You took my scattered thoughts, rough sketches, and stubborn bugs, and helped turn them into something that works—something that means something. Whether you were there offering code reviews, UI feedback, backend logic help, or just emotional support when I was staring at my screen wondering why nothing made sense—your presence was felt.</p>
    <p>This project taught me a lot. Not just about development or design, but about patience, communication, resilience, and the power of working with people who genuinely care. Every sleepless night, every last-minute fix, every shared laugh over bugs that mysteriously fixed themselves—those moments are carved into the heart of this website.</p>
    <p>I want you to know this: your efforts weren’t just seen, they were felt. You didn’t just help me build a website. You helped me build confidence, skill, and a foundation for everything I’ll do going forward.</p>
    <p>This site may have my name on it, but it carries your energy, your insight, and your fingerprints in every line of code, every pixel, and every visitor experience. I’ll never forget that.</p>
    <em><p>So thank you—from the core of who I am. Thank you for sticking around, for caring, for pushing me, for showing up, and for believing that this was worth building.</p></em>
    <br>
    <h5>Here’s to more projects, more passion, more ideas turned into reality—and to the amazing people who helped make this first step so unforgettable.</h5>
